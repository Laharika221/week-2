## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn This Week

Week 2 is organized into *two complementary parts* â€” one focusing on theory and the other on practical simulation.

### ðŸ§© *Part 1 â€“ Conceptual Understanding*
Youâ€™ll explore the foundation of *System-on-Chip design* through:
- What an *SoC* is and why it matters  
- The *main building blocks* of an SoC:
  - *CPU* â€“ Core processing unit  
  - *Memory* â€“ Stores instructions and data  
  - *Peripherals* â€“ Interface components  
  - *Interconnects* â€“ Communication links between subsystems  
- The importance of the *Baby SoC* as an educational and simplified model  
- How *functional modeling* helps validate logic before RTL or layout stages

---

### ðŸ’» *Part 2 â€“ Practical Labs*
Youâ€™ll apply theoretical knowledge through hands-on experiments:
- *Simulate the Baby SoC* using *Icarus Verilog (iverilog)*  
- *Visualize results* and timing with *GTKWave*  
- *Analyze SoC behavior* by observing signals and timing diagrams  
- Capture *screenshots* and explain each waveform output  
- Interpret results to confirm correct SoC operation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

By the end of Week 2, you should be able to:
- Understand *SoC architecture and integration*
- Identify the purpose and function of each Baby SoC component
- Practice *functional verification* early in the design flow
- Gain confidence using open-source simulation tools like:
  - *Icarus Verilog*
  - *GTKWave*

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Deliverables

- Well-structured explanations of *SoC fundamentals*
- *Simulated Baby SoC* with verified waveforms
- Captured *GTKWave screenshots* showing correct signal transitions
- Concise commentary explaining observed behaviors

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights

- An *SoC = CPU + Memory + Peripherals + Interconnect*, all on a single chip.  
- The *Baby SoC* simplifies complex SoC architecture into easy-to-understand modules.  
- *Functional modeling* is the bridge between conceptual learning and hardware design.  
- *Icarus Verilog* and *GTKWave* are essential tools for simulation, debugging, and verification in early design stages.

---

## ðŸ§© Summary

This week forms a crucial bridge between understanding *digital design concepts* and implementing a *real-world SoC*.  
By mastering both the *theoretical* and *functional modeling* aspects of the Baby SoC, youâ€™re preparing for more advanced tasks such as *RTL synthesis, **timing closure, and **physical implementation* in the coming weeks.
